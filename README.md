# Overview

My solutions written in Golang, Java and Kotlin for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## Disclaimer

Note that this code is **hacky, not polished or refactored in any way**, i.e. it is probably the worst spaghetti code
you can imagine. Its sole purpose was to solve the puzzles, it should not be used as example for good code.
That means, after I retrieved the correct solution for a puzzle, **I left the source code as it is without any cleanup**. 
Or stated otherwise, **I intentionally gave myself the permission to hack around...**
